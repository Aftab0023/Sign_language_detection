    <string name="app_name">Sign Detection</string>
    <string name="information">Sign language serves as a primary mode of communication for individuals with hearing impairments, offering a rich and
expressive means of conveying thoughts and ideas. Despite its significance, there exists a communication barrier
between the deaf community and those unfamiliar with sign language. In an effort to bridge this gap and foster
inclusivity, we present a Sign Language Detection System implemented using the versatile and accessible programming
language, Python.
This system leverages advancements in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning to interpret and recognize
sign language gestures. The objective is to provide a technological solution that enables real-time detection and
translation of sign language, thereby facilitating communication between individuals who use sign language and those
who may not be fluent in it.</string>

        Once the letters and numbers are clearly understood, fingerspelling is used to get to proper nouns, names, places, etc., and then for moving to advanced understanding.
The ABC sign language helps anyone simultaneously sign multiple letters and words and form meaningful sentences
